The basic and most wide spread way of making a machine learning model is a descision tree.

**Pandas**

Pandas is the most prefered python library to read, manipulate any dataset.
Dataframe, The basic format of storage of data using pandas, is like a Excel sheet or a Table in SQL.
> pandas.read_csv("File path") is the method to access the data in form of a Dataframe using pandas.
> df.describe() : it describes the data and provides various values like 
        the min, max, average, etc.for the columns in the dataframes
> df = df.dropna(axis = 0) : is used to drop         null values in the data frame.
A Single data column can be selected from the dataframe using dot-notation. Ex: y = df.column_name
To select Features from the given data , a array of selected features is passed to the df[] dataframe.
Example: Features= [array]
         x = df[Features]
> df.head() : is used to print the few upper rows of the dataset 
> df.column : gives the names of all columns in the dataframe.

**scikit-learn**

While writing in a code, scikit-learn is written as sklearn.

The steps to building and using a model are:

#Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
#Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
#Predict: Just what it sounds like
#Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.

To select the DecisionTreeRegression model using scikit-learn
> model_name = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)  "Model Defining"
> modelname.fit(Input_data , Prediction_data)  "Model Fitting"

Specifying random_state to get results in each run. We can use any number for this. It is a good practice.

**Model Validation**

The Method of predicting values based on training data and matching it with the value in the target value in the testing data is not a good method.
